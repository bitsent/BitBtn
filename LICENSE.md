1.  Usage Limitations. The grant to deal provided above is restricted to dealing in the Software only for purposes relating to one or multiple of the following:
    - Purposes related to The Bitcoin SV Blockchain
        - defined as the Bitcoin chain with the most SHA-256 Proof of Work accumulated, following block height #560000 with this hash: 0000000000000000035cb1baaf4f82d8358a8b9ed22aec52c2801a02b9c6f18f.

    In case of competing blockchain protocols, if the difference of their total accumulated Proof of Work is less than the required sufficient advantage, the license is valid on both chains, until one of them gains sufficient advantage in accumulated proof of work.
		- Competing protocols are defined as cryptocurrency protocols originating from the same genesis block (or block with a specific height and hash, if such is specified in the above permission notice) and using the same proof of work algorithm. 
		- A sufficient advantage is an advantage of at least 1000 blocks with the difficulty of the latest block on the chain with more accumulated Proof of Work.
		- The proof of work difficulty of a block is measured by the leading zeroes of its hash, where each extra zero is worth twice as much as the previous one.
			- For example: A block with 4 leading zeroes is measured as 15 units of difficulty (1+2+4+8).
		- The accumulated Proof of Work of a chain is defined as the sum of the difficulties of all the blocks in that chain.
